# Fantasy-Hockey-Projector
Motivated to win my fantasy hockey league, I developed this program to browse through the available players and provide a list of the most valuable ones using an algorithm based around how scarce each of their scoring categories are.

I developed this project because I wanted to use programming to help me fix a real-life "problem". This project helped me evaluate players in
a fast and smart way, telling me which players I should be picking in my fantasy hockey league. 

To use this project, you can clone the repository, and then run the "FantasyHockeyProjector.sln", after updating the Summary.xlsx with a table
of stats/players you'd like to compare.
